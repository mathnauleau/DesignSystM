# 🗺️ Roadmap — DesignSystM

Welcome to the evolving roadmap of **DesignSystM**.  
This isn’t about strict deadlines — it’s about **learning milestones** and **experiments** along the way.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Foundations (Now)
- [x] Define **color tokens** (light & dark mode basics)
- [ ] Create **typography scale** (headings, body, captions)
- [ ] Document **spacing & sizing units**
- [ ] Add first **icon set** (SVGs in `assets/icons/`)
- [ ] Write simple **Foundations docs** in Markdown

---

## 🔄 Phase 2 — Components (Next)
- [ ] Build a **Button** (default, hover, disabled, with icon)
- [ ] Build an **Input field** (text, password, with validation states)
- [ ] Build a **Card** (basic container, with media and actions)
- [ ] Start experimenting with **motion/transition tokens**
- [ ] Document usage in `docs/components.md`

---

## 🧪 Phase 3 — Experiments (Soon)
- [ ] Try **dark mode theme switching**
- [ ] Prototype a **token pipeline** (JSON → CSS variables / JS export)
- [ ] Explore **responsive typography** scaling
- [ ] Test a **Figma plugin export** (tokens → repo sync)
- [ ] Play with **new interaction patterns** (micro-animations, gestures)

---

## 🚀 Phase 4 — Systemizing (Later)
- [ ] Define **contribution guidelines** (if opening repo to others)
- [ ] Create a **storybook-style playground** for components
- [ ] Explore **cross-platform tokens** (Web, iOS, Android, Flutter)
- [ ] Add **linting/automation** (token validation, consistency checks)
- [ ] Draft a **DesignSystM v1.0** milestone release

---

## ✨ Principles Along the Way
- Keep it **fun** → this is a sandbox, not a factory
- Document **why** as much as **what**
- Don’t fear refactors → systems evolve
- Celebrate small wins 🎉
