# Basic Style Dictionary

This example code is bare-bones to show you what this framework can do. If you have the style-dictionary module installed globally, you can `cd` into this directory and run:

```bash
npx style-dictionary build
```

Otherwise, install Style Dictionary locally for this project first, `cd` into this directory and run:

```bash
npm init -y && npm install style-dictionary
```

To run Style dictionary
``` bash
style-dictionary build
style-dictionary build --verbose
