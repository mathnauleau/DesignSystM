# ☞ DesignSystM

Welcome to **DesignSystM** — my personal design system playground.  
(Yes, the **M** stands for **Mathieu** ✌️).  

This repo is where I explore, experiment, and learn about building a design system from the ground up.  
It’s not about being “production-perfect” — it’s about **ideation, iteration, and fun**.



## 🚀 Purpose

- 📚 **Learning**: deep dive into design systems, tokens, and multi-platform thinking  
- 🧪 **Experimenting**: trying out different approaches, tools, and structures  
- 💡 **Ideating**: shaping concepts for future, more robust systems  



## 📂 Structure (work in progress)

The repo is organized to separate **foundations** (the building blocks) from **components** (the UI pieces).  
Here’s the current (and evolving) structure:

```bash
designsystm/
│
├── tokens/          # Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, etc.)
│   ├── color.json
│   ├── typography.json
│   ├── spacing.json
│   └── …
│   └── Ideally some codeGen, from JSON to SCSS etc.
│
├── assets/          # Icons, illustrations, logos, and other brand assets
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── illustrations/
│   └── logos/

├── components/      # For now, a list of md files gathering some insights
│   ├── button/
│   ├── input/
│   ├── card/

├── experiments/     # Wild ideas, prototypes, and “what ifs”
│   ├── motion-tests/

└── docs/            # Documentation, usage guidelines, and examples

## 📌 Note

This repo is **work in progress**. Expect half-baked ideas, scrappy experiments, and sudden shifts in structure.  
That’s the point.
