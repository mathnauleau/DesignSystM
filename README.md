# ☞ DesignSystM

Welcome to **DesignSystM** — my personal design system playground.  
(Yes, the **M** stands for **Mathieu** ✌️).  

This repo is where I explore, experiment, and learn about building a design system from the ground up.  
It’s not about being “production-perfect” — it’s about **ideation, iteration, and fun**.



## 🚀 Purpose

- 📚 **Learning**: deep dive into design systems, tokens, and multi-platform thinking  
- 🧪 **Experimenting**: trying out different approaches, tools, and structures  
- 💡 **Ideating**: shaping concepts for future, more robust systems  



## 📂 Structure (work in progress)

The repo is organized to separate **foundations** (the building blocks) from **components** (the UI pieces).  
Here’s the current (and evolving) structure:

```bash

│   ├── color.json
│   ├── typography.json
│   ├── spacing.json

## 🤝 Contributing

Right now, **DesignSystM** is a personal side project.  
That said, I love feedback, inspiration, or fun ideas. If you stumble here, feel free to:
- Open an issue 💬
- Suggest a cool experiment 🚀
- Share your own learnings 🔗



## 📌 Note

This repo is **work in progress**. Expect half-baked ideas, scrappy experiments, and sudden shifts in structure.  
That’s the point.
